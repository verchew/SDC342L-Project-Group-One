# SDC342L-Project-Group-One (Holly H, Mary L, Ryan M and Corey P.)
  This repository is for our project in Server Side Scripting with PHP. 
  The project is designed such that each unit will build on the objectives in the accompanying course. 
  Each week we will add functionality to the project. 
  At the end of the course, we will have a functional PHP web application that provides an online customer complaint management system - something that many businesses use every day.

Course Goals
Some areas of focus addressed in this course to provide experiences that are directly applicable to working in a software development company include:
  Team-based project - working and coordinating with others to accomplish a task, often in a virtual work environment
  Software project planning - creating tasks to divide large development efforts into specific development activities and prioritizing work efforts
  Software project execution - using a project plan as a time management tool to complete work tasks and provide a weekly status update on work completed
  Source code control - using GitHub as a source code repository to control changes and get feedback on completed code
  Retrospective - reflection at the end of a project with respect to what went well, what went poorly, and ways to improve in future software projects

Week 1 - This week the focus will be on creating a project plan and repository in github that we can use throughout the course to make sure we're staying on track with the development of our course project.
  Created a web application project plan.
  Created a repository in GitHub.

Week 2 -  Creating the Database and Application Framework
  Use a team project plan to create a web application.
  Provide team status updates based on project plan execution.
  Review team project execution and identify lessons learned.
  Create a database and tables using phpMyAdmin.
  Share code files with a team in a GitHub repository.
  Review and provide feedback for team code files stored in a GitHub repository.
  Modify and commit code modifications to a team GitHub repository.
    
Week 3: Representing the Database in PHP Objects
  Create classes to represent database tables.
  Develop a PHP Connection to a database using a PHP object.
  Execute CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations through a PHP class.

Week 4: Add Site Security
  Goal: Implement web application security in three forms: HTTPS, Authentication, and Authorization.
  Authorization: Configured role-based access to ensure only specific users (like Admins) can modify information via the Update action.
  Authentication: Set up secure login credentials, including standardized complexity requirements (e.g., P@ssword1234) for test        accounts.
  Successfully resolved primary key and foreign key constraint issues to ensure data integrity across the system.

Week 5: Allow Users to Upload Files
  Goal: Enable file upload functionality to allow users to attach relevant documentation or images to their support complaints.
  Upload, manipulate, and display image files.
