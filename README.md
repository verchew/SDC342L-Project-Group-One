# SDC342L-Project-Group-One (Holly H, Mary L, Ryan M and Corey P.)
  This repository is for our project in Server Side Scripting with PHP. 
  The project is designed such that each unit will build on the objectives in the accompanying course. 
  Each week we will add functionality to the project. 
  At the end of the course, we will have a functional PHP web application that provides an online customer complaint management system - something that many businesses use every day.

Course Goals
Some areas of focus addressed in this course to provide experiences that are directly applicable to working in a software development company include:
  Team-based project - working and coordinating with others to accomplish a task, often in a virtual work environment
  Software project planning - creating tasks to divide large development efforts into specific development activities and prioritizing work efforts
  Software project execution - using a project plan as a time management tool to complete work tasks and provide a weekly status update on work completed
  Source code control - using GitHub as a source code repository to control changes and get feedback on completed code
  Retrospective - reflection at the end of a project with respect to what went well, what went poorly, and ways to improve in future software projects

Week 1 - This week the focus will be on creating a project plan and repository in github that we can use throughout the course to make sure we're staying on track with the development of our course project.
